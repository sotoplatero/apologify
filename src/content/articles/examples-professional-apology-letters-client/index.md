This is not only important for maintaining a good rapport but also vital for fostering long-term relationships. 

A heartfelt apology can transform a potentially damaging situation into an opportunity for growth, both for you and your client. It can showcase your professionalism, responsibility, and commitment to customer satisfaction.
