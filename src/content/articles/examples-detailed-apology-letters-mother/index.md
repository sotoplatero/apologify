I want to do better, and I promise to listen more actively in the future. Thank you for being my guiding star, and please forgive me for my thoughtlessness.

>
> I miss our chats and the warmth of being with you. Moving forward, I want to make a concerted effort to keep in touch more regularly. Let's schedule a weekly phone call or coffee date. I am grateful for everything you've done for me and I love you dearly.

If an argument escalated and you said hurtful things that you later regretted, here’s how to address that.

> Dear Mom,
>
> I’ve been thinking about our argument and I want to sincerely apologize for the harsh words I spoke. I let my emotions get the best of me, which is never an excuse for treating you that way. You deserve respect and kindness, just as you’ve always shown me.
>
> Please know that I deeply regret those hurtful exchanges and I am committed to handling disagreements more respectfully in the future. Your love means the world to me, and I hope you can see my genuine remorse. Let’s move forward together with love.
