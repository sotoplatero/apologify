## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Writing an Apology Letter

Writing an effective apology requires care. Here are common mistakes to avoid to ensure your apology is well-received:

### Not Taking Full Responsibility

**Explanation:** Failing to acknowledge how your actions affected your partner can make your apology feel empty.

**How to Avoid It:** Be specific about what you did wrong and recognize the impact it had on them.

**How to Avoid It:** Clearly outline steps you will take to ensure the mistake doesn’t happen again.
