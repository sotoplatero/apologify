## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Writing an Apology Letter

When crafting your empathetic apology letter, be mindful of common pitfalls that can undermine your sincerity.

### Not Taking Full Responsibility

### Focusing Only on the Company’s Perspective

**Explanation:** Ignoring the customer’s feelings can come off as self-serving.  
**How to Avoid It:** Make the letter about the customer’s experience and feelings rather than just your justification.

### Rushing the Apology Process

**Explanation:** A hastily written letter can come off as insincere.  
**How to Avoid It:** Take your time to reflect on the situation and convey genuine empathy.
