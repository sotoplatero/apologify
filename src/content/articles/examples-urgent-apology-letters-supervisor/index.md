**How to Avoid It:** Be sure to acknowledge how your actions affected your supervisor and the team to show empathy.

### Over-Apologizing

**How to Avoid It:** Offer a heartfelt apology and then focus on what you're doing to rectify the situation.

### Skipping a Plan for Improvement

By expressing your genuine remorse and outlining steps for improvement, you're demonstrating your commitment to being a better team member.
