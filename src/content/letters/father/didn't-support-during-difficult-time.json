    "Dear Dad,\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I’ve been reflecting on the past few weeks, and I feel compelled to reach out and express something that’s been heavy on my heart. \n\nI want to sincerely apologize for not being there for you during what I know has been a difficult time. I realize now how important it is to have the support of loved ones during challenging moments, and I regret that I wasn’t able to provide that for you when you needed it most. My silence may have felt like indifference, but please know that was never my intention.\n\nYou have always been a pillar of strength for me, guiding me through my own tough times and offering your unwavering support. It pains me to think that I let you down when you deserved my love and reassurance in return. I understand that my absence may have added to the burden you were already carrying, and for that, I am truly sorry.\n\nI am committed to being more present in your life and ensuring you know you're not alone. You deserve all the support and care, and I’m here to make that right. Thank you for your understanding, and I hope to rebuild the trust and connection that may have wavered.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
