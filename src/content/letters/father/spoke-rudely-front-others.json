    "Hey Dad,\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to say I'm really sorry for the way I spoke to you the other day in front of everyone. I didn’t mean to be rude, and I know it wasn't cool. I got caught up in the moment and didn’t consider how it would affect you. \n\nI value our relationship and never want to disrespect you like that. I appreciate everything you do and hope you can forgive me. Let’s grab a coffee soon—I’d love to chat and make things right.\n\nThanks for being patient with me.\n\nLove you!  \n[Your Name]"
