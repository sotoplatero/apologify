    "Dear Dad,\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I’ve been reflecting on my recent actions, and I want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for how I handled the money you lent me. \n\nI know that you trusted me with that responsibility, and I let you down by being careless with it. I acted thoughtlessly and didn’t consider the weight of that trust. It’s been weighing heavily on my mind, and I truly regret not being more responsible. \n\nI understand how hard you work for your money, and I recognize that I’ve not only disappointed you but also missed a valuable opportunity to learn from this experience. I’m committed to making better choices moving forward and ensuring that I regain your trust.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and for always being there for me. I promise to rectify my mistakes and respect the support you’ve given me.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]",
