    "Hey Dad,\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to say I'm really sorry for forgetting Father's Day. I can't believe I let it slip my mind, and I feel awful about it. You mean so much to me, and I truly appreciate everything you do.\n\nI hope you know how much I love and respect you, even if I messed up this time. Let’s plan a get-together soon—I’d love to treat you to lunch or something to make it up to you. \n\nThanks for being such an amazing dad. I’m lucky to have you.\n\nLove you!\n\n[Your Name]"
