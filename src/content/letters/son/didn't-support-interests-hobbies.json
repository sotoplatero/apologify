    "Dear [Son's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately, and I feel compelled to reach out and express something that weighs heavily on my heart.\n\nI want to sincerely apologize for not being as supportive of your interests and hobbies as I should have been. It pains me to realize that I may have unintentionally made you feel like your passions weren’t important to me. Please know that this was never my intention, and I deeply regret not being more enthusiastic in encouraging you.\n\nYour pursuits matter so much, and I wish I had taken the time to understand and celebrate them with you. I recognize that by not engaging, I may have missed the opportunity to connect with you in a way that’s meaningful, and for that, I am truly sorry. I want to do better moving forward.\n\nI’m here now, ready to listen and support you in any way I can. Please share with me what you love, and let me be a part of those moments. Your interests deserve to be celebrated, and I want to be the parent you can count on for encouragement and support.\n\nThank you for your understanding and patience with me. I love you, and I am committed to being there for you.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]",
    "Dear Son,\n\nI hope this note finds you in good spirits. I’ve been reflecting on our recent conversations, and I want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for not supporting your interests and hobbies as I should have. I recognize that I haven’t given you the encouragement you deserve, and that’s something I deeply regret.\n\nYour passions are a vital part of who you are, and I now understand how important it is for you to have someone in your corner cheering you on. I realize that my lack of support may have made you feel undervalued or misunderstood, and I’m truly sorry for any hurt that caused you.\n\nMoving forward, I want to ensure that I am not just present but also actively engaged in what brings you joy. Your interests matter to me, and I promise to do better—whether it’s attending your events, learning more about your hobbies, or simply listening to you share your excitement about them. \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I love you and I’m proud of you, and I’m committed to being the supportive parent you need.\n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]"
