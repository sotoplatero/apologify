    "My dear son,\n\nI hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I wanted to take a moment to express how truly sorry I am for the way I spoke to you recently. My criticism was too harsh, and I realize now that it may have hurt you more than I intended. \n\nI never want to make you feel belittled or discouraged, especially when all you want is to do your best. It pains me to think I may have contributed to any self-doubt you might be feeling. You are an incredible person with immense potential, and I should have supported you with kindness and understanding instead of expressing my frustrations.\n\nPlease know that my intentions are always to help you grow and learn, but I understand that my delivery was far from supportive. I value our relationship more than anything, and it breaks my heart to think that I may have put a strain on it.\n\nI promise to work on being more thoughtful and gentle with my words in the future. You deserve a parent who uplifts and encourages you, and I am committed to being that for you.\n\nThank you for your patience with me, and for being the wonderful person you are. I love you deeply and look forward to making this right.\n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]"
