I realize now that they were unrealistic and may have caused you unnecessary stress and frustration.\n\nIt was never my intention to put pressure on you or make you feel like you weren’t measuring up. I recognize that I should have been more understanding of your individual journey and the pace that works best for you. You are doing your best, and I appreciate all of your efforts, even if they don’t align with the standards I thought were best.\n\nPlease know that I love you deeply and support you wholeheartedly. Moving forward, I promise to be more mindful of the expectations I set. I want to encourage you to follow your own path and celebrate your unique achievements, no matter how big or small.\n\nThank you for your understanding and for being such an amazing son. I am proud of you, and I’m always here for you.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]",
