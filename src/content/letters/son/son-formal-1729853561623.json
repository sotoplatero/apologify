I recognize that there are moments when having someone to listen can make a significant difference, and I regret that I was unable to provide that support for you when it mattered most.\n\nIt was never my intention to dismiss your feelings or concerns, and I deeply regret any hurt my lack of attentiveness may have caused you. Your thoughts and emotions are important to me, and I want you to know that I am here for you. I am committed to doing better and ensuring that I am more available and receptive in the future.\n\nPlease know that I value our relationship and the trust you place in me. I am always willing to listen and support you when you need it. Thank you for your understanding, and I hope we can move forward together.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]",
