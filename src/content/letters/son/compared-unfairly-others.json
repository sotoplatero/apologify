    "My dear son,\n\nI want to take a moment to express how truly sorry I am for the words I spoke recently. In comparing you to others, I failed to see the incredible person that you are and the unique path youâ€™re carving for yourself. I know this must have hurt you, and for that, I am deeply regretful.\n\nYou have so many wonderful qualities that set you apart, qualities that I admire more than I can say. You are intelligent, kind, and hardworking, and I should have celebrated those traits instead of letting insecurity and comparison cloud my judgment. I realize now that no one should have to live in the shadow of others, especially not you.\n\nPlease know that my love for you is unconditional, and I never want you to doubt your worth because of my misguided words. You are enough just as you are, and I am proud to be your parent. I promise to be more mindful and supportive moving forward, recognizing your individuality and what makes you shine.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I hope that you can forgive me, as I strive to learn from this experience and become a better parent for you.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]",
    "Dear Son,\n\nI want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for something that has been weighing heavily on my heart. Recently, I compared you to others in ways that were unfair and hurtful. I see now how my words may have made you feel inadequate, and I am truly sorry for that.\n\nYou are an incredible person with your own unique strengths and talents. My intention was never to diminish your worth or make you feel less than anyone else. I realize that each of us has our own journey, and it is not fair to compare your achievements to anyone else's. You should be celebrated for who you are, not judged against someone else's highlight reel.\n\nI want you to know how proud I am of you and all that you have accomplished. I will do my best to support and encourage you without making those unfair comparisons in the future. You mean the world to me, and it pains me to think that I may have caused you doubt or sadness.\n\nThank you for your understanding and for giving me the opportunity to learn from this. I love you dearly and am committed to being a better parent for you.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
