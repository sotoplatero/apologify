    "My dear son,\n\nI want to take a moment to express how truly sorry I am for the words I spoke recently. In comparing you to others, I failed to see the incredible person that you are and the unique path youâ€™re carving for yourself. I know this must have hurt you, and for that, I am deeply regretful.\n\nYou have so many wonderful qualities that set you apart, qualities that I admire more than I can say. You are intelligent, kind, and hardworking, and I should have celebrated those traits instead of letting insecurity and comparison cloud my judgment. I realize now that no one should have to live in the shadow of others, especially not you.\n\nPlease know that my love for you is unconditional, and I never want you to doubt your worth because of my misguided words. You are enough just as you are, and I am proud to be your parent. I promise to be more mindful and supportive moving forward, recognizing your individuality and what makes you shine.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I hope that you can forgive me, as I strive to learn from this experience and become a better parent for you.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
