    "Dear [Son's Name],\n\nI want to take a moment to express how truly sorry I am for the way I lost my temper and the hurtful things I said to you. I can’t begin to convey how much regret I feel for letting my emotions get the better of me. You did not deserve to hear those words, and I deeply regret the pain I caused you.\n\nI know that my actions not only affected you in the moment but may have also shaken the trust and comfort we share. As your parent, it’s my responsibility to provide you with support and love, and I failed to do that when it mattered most.\n\nI want you to know that I am committed to working on myself and finding healthier ways to express my feelings. You mean the world to me, and I will do everything I can to prevent this from happening again. I care so much about our relationship, and I hope we can talk about this when you’re ready. \n\nThank you for your understanding and patience with me. I love you very much and want to make things right.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
