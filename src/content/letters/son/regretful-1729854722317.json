It was never my intention to overstep boundaries or make you feel uncomfortable, and I realize now how my actions could have impacted your trust in me.\n\nI understand that our personal spaces are important, and I should have respected yours. It pains me to think that I might have caused you any distress or frustration. You deserve to feel secure and respected, and I failed to uphold that expectation.\n\nPlease know that I am reflecting on this mistake and learning from it. Your feelings matter greatly to me, and I promise to do better moving forward. You can always talk to me about anything, and I will make every effort to listen and respect your wishes.\n\nThank you for your understanding and patience with me. I hope we can work through this together.\n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]",
