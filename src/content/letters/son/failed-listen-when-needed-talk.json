    "Dear [Son's Name],\n\nI want to take a moment to express how truly sorry I am for not being there for you when you needed to talk. I realize now that I failed to listen and support you during a time when my attention was so crucial. It breaks my heart to know that I let you down.\n\nYou deserve to be heard and understood, and it pains me to think that I missed the opportunity to be that person for you. I know how important it is to share your thoughts and feelings, and I regret that I didn’t create that space for you when you needed it most. \n\nPlease know that I deeply care about you and your feelings. I am committed to doing better and making sure you always feel valued and supported. I hope you can forgive me for not being the listener you needed. Moving forward, I promise to prioritize our conversations and be fully present whenever you want to talk.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and for being patient with me. I love you, and I am here for you—always.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]",
    "Dear [Son's Name],\n\nI hope you can take a moment to read this note. I want to express how truly sorry I am for not being there for you when you needed someone to talk to. I realize that my lack of attention must have hurt you, and that thought fills me with regret.\n\nYou are important to me, and I should have listened when you were reaching out. I know that communication is key in our relationship, and I failed to uphold that when it mattered most. Please understand that it was never my intention to dismiss your feelings or your need for support.\n\nI want to do better, not just for you, but for us. Your feelings are valid, and I want to assure you that I am here to listen now. If you are willing, I would love the opportunity to hear what’s on your mind—whenever you feel ready to share.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I truly appreciate you and am committed to being a better listener moving forward.\n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]",
    "Hey Buddy,\n\nSo, it turns out my superpower of selective hearing really flared up the other day, and I completely missed your call to chat. My bad! I promise I wasn't practicing for a role in a sitcom where the dad has the attention span of a goldfish. \n\nI know you had something important to say, and instead, I was probably too busy trying to figure out which sock to wear—like that’s a life-altering decision. As a result, I totally dropped the ball on being the supportive, ear-to-the-ground dad you rightfully deserve. \n\nI assure you, I’m not planning to audition for \"The Absentee Listener\" award anytime soon. I want to hear all about what’s on your mind—whether it’s a new game strategy, a tough school project, or just why snack time should be rebranded as ‘essential life support’—I'm all ears now!\n\nLet's find some time soon to chat. I’ll even bribe you with cookies. You bring the topics, and I promise to bring my A-list listening skills (and a side of snacks)!\n\nAgain, I’m truly sorry for not being there when you needed me. I’m learning the hard way that ears are just as important as mouths—who knew?\n\nLove you tons and looking forward to our next chat!\n\nYour award-winning (listening) dad"
