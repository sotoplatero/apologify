    "Dear [Son's Name],\n\nI want to take a moment to express how truly sorry I am for not being there for you when you needed to talk. I realize now that I failed to listen and support you during a time when my attention was so crucial. It breaks my heart to know that I let you down.\n\nYou deserve to be heard and understood, and it pains me to think that I missed the opportunity to be that person for you. I know how important it is to share your thoughts and feelings, and I regret that I didn’t create that space for you when you needed it most. \n\nPlease know that I deeply care about you and your feelings. I am committed to doing better and making sure you always feel valued and supported. I hope you can forgive me for not being the listener you needed. Moving forward, I promise to prioritize our conversations and be fully present whenever you want to talk.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and for being patient with me. I love you, and I am here for you—always.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
