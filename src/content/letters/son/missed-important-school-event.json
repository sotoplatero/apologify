    "Dear [Son's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you not too traumatized from my abysmal parenting skills, which led to my major faux pas of missing your important school event. I’ve thought long and hard about how I could have possibly overlooked it, and I’ve narrowed it down to three potential theories: \n\n1. **Time Travel:** I briefly attempted to invent a time machine but ended up lost in a Netflix rabbit hole instead. Spoiler: I still don’t know what happened in the last season of that show.\n\n2. **Selective Memory:** I seem to have a superpower that allows me to completely forget crucial dates, like how I remember to buy ice cream but not when my son has his big school presentations. (Priorities, right?)\n\n3. **Alien Abduction:** I’ve been abducted by aliens who were really keen on asking me for directions but then got sidetracked by talking about their favorite Earth snacks. \n\nBut all jokes aside, I know how important this event was for you, and I genuinely regret not being there. I’m truly sorry for missing out on cheering you on. I promise to atone for my absence with ice cream sundaes, a movie marathon, and by being your number one fan from here on out—no aliens or ice cream distractions!\n\nYou are amazing, and I’m proud of everything you do, even when I’m not there to see it. Let’s catch up and hear all about the event; I want to celebrate your awesomeness, even if I missed the live show!\n\nLove you tons (and even more when I’m not missing important dates),\n\n[Your Name]"
