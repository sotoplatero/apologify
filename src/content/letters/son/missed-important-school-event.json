    "Dear [Son's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you not too traumatized from my abysmal parenting skills, which led to my major faux pas of missing your important school event. I’ve thought long and hard about how I could have possibly overlooked it, and I’ve narrowed it down to three potential theories: \n\n1. **Time Travel:** I briefly attempted to invent a time machine but ended up lost in a Netflix rabbit hole instead. Spoiler: I still don’t know what happened in the last season of that show.\n\n2. **Selective Memory:** I seem to have a superpower that allows me to completely forget crucial dates, like how I remember to buy ice cream but not when my son has his big school presentations. (Priorities, right?)\n\n3. **Alien Abduction:** I’ve been abducted by aliens who were really keen on asking me for directions but then got sidetracked by talking about their favorite Earth snacks. \n\nBut all jokes aside, I know how important this event was for you, and I genuinely regret not being there. I’m truly sorry for missing out on cheering you on. I promise to atone for my absence with ice cream sundaes, a movie marathon, and by being your number one fan from here on out—no aliens or ice cream distractions!\n\nYou are amazing, and I’m proud of everything you do, even when I’m not there to see it. Let’s catch up and hear all about the event; I want to celebrate your awesomeness, even if I missed the live show!\n\nLove you tons (and even more when I’m not missing important dates),\n\n[Your Name]",
    "Dear [Son's Name],\n\nI want to start this note by saying how truly sorry I am for missing your important school event. I know how much it meant to you, and it breaks my heart that I wasn’t there to support you and celebrate your hard work.\n\nIt was never my intention to let you down, and I can only imagine how disappointed you must have felt seeing the empty seat where I should have been. You deserve a parent who is present in your moments of achievement, and I regret that I wasn’t able to be there for you this time.\n\nPlease know that I am proud of you and all the effort you put into your schoolwork and activities. I promise to make it up to you and be more present in the future. Your accomplishments matter so much to me, and I want you to feel my support every step of the way.\n\nThank you for your understanding and forgiveness. Let’s plan a special day together soon to celebrate all your hard work and the milestones ahead.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
