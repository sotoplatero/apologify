    "Dear [Son's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you well, though I know I might not deserve your understanding right now. I want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for breaking my promise to spend time together. I know how much it meant to us both, and I deeply regret letting you down.\n\nLife sometimes has a way of overwhelming us, pulling our attention in directions we didn’t intend to go. But that’s no excuse for not being there for you when I promised I would. You are incredibly important to me, and I hate that I missed the chance to connect and create memories with you.\n\nI want you to know that it wasn’t my intention to make you feel unvalued or ignored. You deserve my full attention and commitment, and I acknowledge that I fell short this time. I am truly sorry for any disappointment I caused you.\n\nPlease know that I am working on making more time for us and ensuring that I keep my promises in the future. I hope you can forgive me for this mistake, and we can find an opportunity to spend time together soon. \n\nThank you for being such an understanding and patient son. I love you dearly and am committed to making it right.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
