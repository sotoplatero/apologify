    "Dear [Son's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for invading your privacy. I understand now how important it is for you to have your own space and boundaries, and I deeply regret crossing that line.\n\nI acted without thinking and didn’t consider how my actions might affect you. Your trust means everything to me, and I know I’ve put a strain on that by not respecting your privacy. It was never my intention to hurt you or make you feel uncomfortable, and for that, I am truly sorry.\n\nPlease know that I am committed to doing better. I want to learn from this mistake and rebuild the trust we've shared. If you’re open to it, I’d love the chance to talk about how we can move forward together.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and again, I’m really sorry.\n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]"
