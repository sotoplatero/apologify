    "Dear [Daughter's Name],\n\nI hope you can take a moment to read this note, as it's truly important for me to express how deeply sorry I am for not respecting your boundaries. I understand that our relationship thrives on trust and mutual respect, and my actions fell short of that recently.\n\nI realize now that when I pushed you to share more than you were comfortable with, it not only made you feel overwhelmed but also diminished our connection. I never intended to hurt you, and I regret that my actions made you feel this way. Your feelings and boundaries matter immensely to me, and I promise to be more mindful and supportive moving forward.\n\nPlease know that I care about you deeply and want to prioritize your comfort and autonomy. I am here to listen and learn from this experience so that I can be a better parent to you. Your needs are valid, and I respect every boundary you set.\n\nThank you for your understanding and patience as we navigate this together. I love you more than words can express, and I hope we can continue to strengthen our bond.\n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]"
