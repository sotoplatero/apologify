    "Dear [Daughter's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I’ve been thinking about you a lot lately, and there’s something weighing heavily on my heart that I need to express. I am deeply sorry for missing your [specific milestone, e.g., graduation, birthday, dance recital]. \n\nI cannot begin to express how much I regret not being there to celebrate such an important moment in your life. You have worked so hard, and you deserved to have every single person who cares about you present to share in your joy. It pains me to know that I let you down during this significant time. \n\nI want you to know how proud I am of you and everything you have achieved. You are so talented and remarkable, and it breaks my heart to think that my absence may have diminished the happiness of your accomplishment. Please understand that my intentions were never to miss out on something so important to you.\n\nI understand that my absence may have hurt you, and for that, I am truly sorry. You mean the world to me, and it is my hope that you can forgive me. I promise to prioritize our time together moving forward, and I want to make it up to you in any way that I can. \n\nYou are always in my thoughts, and I am here for you whenever you need me. I love you so much, and I hope we can create more beautiful memories together in the future.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
