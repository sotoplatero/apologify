    "Dear [Daughter's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I want to take a moment to express my sincerest apologies for not being there for you emotionally when you needed support most. Reflecting on recent events, I realize how important it is to have someone to lean on during difficult times, and I regret that I wasn’t able to fulfill that role for you.\n\nI understand that my absence may have made you feel isolated and unsupported, and for that, I am truly sorry. Please know that it was never my intention to overlook your needs. I am committed to being more present and attuned to your feelings moving forward.\n\nYou deserve to have a family member who listens, understands, and offers support when times are tough. I am here for you now, and I hope that we can reconnect and discuss how I can be more supportive in the future.\n\nThank you for your understanding and for allowing me the opportunity to learn from this experience. I deeply care about you and your well-being.\n\nWith love,  \n[Your Name]",
    "Hey there, my beautiful daughter,\n\nI must start this note with an apology that is as sincere as a cat pretending to listen to its owner. I realize that when you needed me most, I somehow turned into a pizza delivery person who forgot the garlic knots—support without extra cheesy goodness! \n\nLife can be a rollercoaster, and it seems I got stuck on a kiddie ride when you were facing a wild loop-de-loop. Instead of being your trusty sidekick, I was probably off fighting imaginary dragons—or maybe just deeply engrossed in the thrilling plot of my favorite TV show (guilty as charged). \n\nI genuinely regret not being the emotional support champion you deserved. I should’ve been there, ready to arm wrestle your worries away or at least hand you a tissue while we watched our favorite sad movie (you know the one that always makes you cry—yes, I’m looking at you, \"The Notebook\"). \n\nJust know that I’m here now, with a big ole heart and a snack supply that could rival any professional pantry. You can always count on me for cheesy jokes, butt-kicking advice (seriously, I've been practicing), and all the hugs you could ever want (with no limits, I promise). \n\nLet’s order pizza and binge-watch those tear-jerkers together—figuratively and literally! I’m committed to being your emotional support rock, not just the background character in your life movie.\n\nSo here’s to making amends and maybe failing spectacularly at it over another pizza night!\n\nLove you more than I love pizza (and that’s saying something!),\n\nYour slightly clueless but always loving parent"
