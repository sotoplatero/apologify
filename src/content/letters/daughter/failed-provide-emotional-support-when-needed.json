    "Dear [Daughter's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I want to take a moment to express my sincerest apologies for not being there for you emotionally when you needed support most. Reflecting on recent events, I realize how important it is to have someone to lean on during difficult times, and I regret that I wasnâ€™t able to fulfill that role for you.\n\nI understand that my absence may have made you feel isolated and unsupported, and for that, I am truly sorry. Please know that it was never my intention to overlook your needs. I am committed to being more present and attuned to your feelings moving forward.\n\nYou deserve to have a family member who listens, understands, and offers support when times are tough. I am here for you now, and I hope that we can reconnect and discuss how I can be more supportive in the future.\n\nThank you for your understanding and for allowing me the opportunity to learn from this experience. I deeply care about you and your well-being.\n\nWith love,  \n[Your Name]"
