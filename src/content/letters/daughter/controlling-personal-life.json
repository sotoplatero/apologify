    "Dear [Daughter's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you well and not too deeply entrenched in a Netflix binge. I've been doing some serious thinking (don’t worry, I wore a helmet), and I realized that I may have been a tad too controlling of your personal life. It's like I mistook my role as a parent for that of a overly enthusiastic stage director in a soap opera—“And now, for your next date, consider wearing more plaid!” \n\nI can’t promise I’ll stop being a little bit opinionated (especially when it comes to your choice of snacks—pizza should always be considered a food group), but I do want to apologize for stepping over the line. I should have trusted your instincts more, even if they sometimes lead to questionable fashion choices or that “artistic” haircut you experimented with in high school.\n\nYou’re an amazing young woman, and I have no doubt that you’ll navigate life’s ups and downs with grace—even if I secretly want to put up road signs to help you avoid the potholes! My love for you is immense, and I truly believe in your ability to make your own decisions... even if I’d prefer you not to date someone who wears socks with sandals. \n\nFrom now on, I’ll try to take a step back and let you steer your own ship (just know that I'll be in the lifeboat, equipped with snacks and unsolicited advice). Thank you for putting up with my well-meaning, albeit sometimes smothering, parenting style. You’re handling this “life” thing like a pro, and I’m proud of you every day.\n\nWith love, a hint of embarrassment, and lots of hugs,\n\n[Your Name]"
