    "Dear [Daughter's Name],\n\nI want to take a moment to express my heartfelt apologies for my words and actions. Comparing you to others was both unfair and hurtful, and I deeply regret letting those thoughts come into my mind and out of my mouth. \n\nYou are a unique and remarkable person, and I should celebrate your individuality rather than measuring you against anyone else. In doing so, I caused you pain, and for that, I am truly sorry. You have your own talents and strengths, and I should have focused on recognizing and nurturing those instead of making comparisons that only undermined your self-worth.\n\nPlease know that I am committed to being more mindful of my words in the future. You deserve unconditional support and love, and I want to make sure you always feel that from me. Thank you for being the wonderful, resilient person you are, and for allowing me the opportunity to learn from my mistakes. \n\nI love you more than words can express, and I hope you can forgive me. \n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]"
