    "Dear [Teacher's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my sincere apologies for my failure to participate in the recent group projects. I understand that teamwork is essential in our learning process, and by not contributing, I have let both you and my classmates down.\n\nI take full responsibility for my lack of engagement and recognize the impact it has on my peers and the overall dynamics of the group. This experience has taught me valuable lessons about accountability and the importance of collaboration in achieving our common goals.\n\nI assure you that I am taking steps to improve my participation in future assignments. I am committed to actively working with my peers and contributing meaningfully to our projects. Your guidance and support have always been invaluable, and I hope to demonstrate my dedication to our class moving forward.\n\nThank you for your understanding. I appreciate your patience and commitment to our education.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"
