    "I want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for my behavior towards your family. I realize that my words and actions were disrespectful, and I deeply regret any hurt I may have caused you and your loved ones.\n\nYou know how much I care about you, and it pains me to think that I may have put a strain on your relationship with your family because of my thoughtlessness.

I am committed to doing better and to treating your family with the love and respect they deserve. I hope to learn from this experience and ensure it never happens again.\n\nThank you for your understanding and for always being patient with me. I love you and appreciate everything you do to bring us together as a family. Let’s talk about this when you’re ready. \n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]"
