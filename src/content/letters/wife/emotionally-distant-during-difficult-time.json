    "My Dearest [Wife's Name],\n\nI hope you can take a moment to read these words, as I want to express something that has been heavy on my heart. I want to sincerely apologize for being emotionally distant during a time when you needed my support the most. \n\nI recognize that my behavior may have caused you pain, and for that, I am truly sorry. There were moments when you reached out for connection and comfort, and instead of being there for you, I pulled away. Looking back, I can see how my actions may have added to your struggles, and it hurts to think that I contributed to your feelings of isolation. \n\nPlease understand that my distance was not a reflection of my love for you. I was grappling with my own challenges, and in trying to process my feelings, I unintentionally shut you out. This was never my intention, and I deeply regret not being the partner you deserved during such a difficult time.\n\nYou mean the world to me, and I am committed to learning from this experience. I want to be better for you, to be the husband you can lean on without hesitation. I promise to listen more, to communicate openly, and to be present for you as you navigate life's challenges.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I am here now, ready to support you and to rebuild the connection that means so much to both of us. I love you more than words can express, and I hope to show you that through my actions moving forward.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
