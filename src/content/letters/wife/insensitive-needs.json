    "Dear [Wife's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you at a moment when you can reflect on my words with an open heart. I am writing to express my deepest apologies for my insensitivity to your needs recently. It has come to my attention that I have not been as attentive and understanding as you deserve, and for that, I am truly sorry.\n\nI recognize that my actions and words may have caused you pain, and there is no excuse for not being more aware of your feelings. You are an essential part of my life, and your well-being is of utmost importance to me. I regret that my behavior may have made you feel undervalued and overlooked.\n\nPlease know that I am committed to making meaningful changes and ensuring that I listen to you more intently in the future. You deserve a partner who is fully present and supportive, and I am dedicated to being that for you.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I love you dearly and am willing to put in the effort to strengthen our relationship. I hope we can discuss this further when you feel ready.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
