I realize that I have fallen short in encouraging you and being present during a time that was important to you.\n\nI understand how passionate you are about your career and how much effort you invest in achieving your goals. My lack of support may have made you feel unvalued or isolated during this critical phase, and for that, I am truly sorry. You deserve someone who stands by you enthusiastically, celebrating your victories and providing comfort during challenges, and I acknowledge that I have not fulfilled that role as I should have.\n\nPlease know that my love and respect for you are unwavering. I am committed to making this right and becoming a better partner who actively supports your dreams. I want to be your biggest cheerleader, empowering you to reach your goals and ensuring that you never feel alone in this journey again.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I appreciate the opportunity to learn from this experience, and I am dedicated to growing both individually and together as a couple. Your aspirations matter deeply to me, and I will strive to show that through my actions moving forward.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
