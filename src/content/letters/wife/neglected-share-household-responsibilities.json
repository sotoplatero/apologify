    "Dear [Wife's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you in good spirits. I am writing to sincerely apologize for my recent neglect of our household responsibilities. I recognize that I have not been contributing my fair share, and this has placed an undue burden on you.\n\nI understand that managing our home is not a one-person job, and I deeply regret my lack of support during this time. It is never my intention to let you down, and I am truly sorry for any frustration or stress my actions may have caused.\n\nPlease know that I am committed to making amends. I appreciate all that you do to maintain our household, and I want to ensure that we share these responsibilities more equitably moving forward. I am ready to take on specific tasks and to communicate more openly about how we can work together to create a balanced environment.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I value our partnership immensely and aim to contribute to our home in a way that is deserving of your trust and love.\n\nWith sincere apologies,\n\n[Your Name]"
