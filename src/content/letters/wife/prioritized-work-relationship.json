    "My Dearest [Wife's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing today to express my heartfelt apologies for my recent behavior and the impact it has had on our relationship. I have come to realize that I allowed the demands of my work to overshadow the love, respect, and attention that you rightfully deserve.\n\nIt was never my intention to make you feel unappreciated or to distance myself from you. I understand that by prioritizing work over our relationship, I neglected the precious bond we share. You have been my partner, my confidante, and my greatest support, and I have not honored that the way I should have.\n\nI genuinely regret the moments I missed and the feelings I hurt in my pursuit of professional goals. I recognize that a fulfilling relationship requires time, attention, and nurturing, and I failed to provide that to you. Please know that I am committed to making amends and ensuring that this will not happen again in the future.\n\nI cherish our time together and the memories we create. I promise to be more mindful of our relationship moving forward and to prioritize our love above all else, as it deserves to be. Thank you for your understanding, patience, and the unwavering strength you have shown me during this time.\n\nI hope we can discuss this further when you feel ready. Your feelings are important to me, and I want to ensure that I listen and understand your perspective fully. \n\nWith all my love and sincerest apologies,\n\n[Your Name]"
