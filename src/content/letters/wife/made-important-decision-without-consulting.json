    "Hey Love,\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to say I’m really sorry for making that decision without talking to you first. I realize now that it wasn’t fair to you and I should have involved you in the conversation. Your opinion means the world to me, and I totally dropped the ball this time.\n\nI know that we always make choices together, and I messed up by going solo on this one. I promise to be more mindful moving forward and to always keep you in the loop. Let’s chat about it when you’re ready—I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nThanks for being so understanding. I’m lucky to have you by my side.\n\nLove you tons,  \n[Your Name]"
