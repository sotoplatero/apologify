    "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I have been reflecting on our recent conversations, and I feel I need to reach out and express my sincerest apologies.\n\nI realize that my comments about your life choices were judgmental and insensitive. It was never my intention to make you feel uncomfortable or undervalued. I now see that my words came from a place of misunderstanding rather than support, and for that, I am truly sorry.\n\nYour journey is unique to you, and it’s filled with experiences that have shaped who you are. I deeply regret not recognizing that sooner and for not being the friend you deserve. I admire your courage to make choices that resonate with you, and I appreciate the trust you place in me to share your life.\n\nPlease know that I am committed to being more understanding and supportive moving forward. I value our friendship dearly and hope that we can move past this misunderstanding. If you’re open to it, I would love to talk more about this and hear your feelings.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I am lucky to have you in my life, and I want to be a better friend.\n\nWarmly,  \n[Your Name]",
    "I hope this note finds you well. I've been reflecting on our recent conversations, and I want to take a moment to express how truly sorry I am for my judgmental comments about your life choices. \n\nLooking back, I realize that my words may have caused you pain, and that was never my intention. I let my own biases cloud my judgment, and it was wrong of me to impose my views on you, especially when you are doing what feels right for your own life. You deserve support and understanding, not criticism.\n\nI value our friendship immensely, and it pains me to think that I’ve put a strain on it with my insensitivity. I want you to know that I respect your decisions and the journey you’re on. Please forgive me for my thoughtlessness. I promise I will be more mindful and supportive moving forward.\n\nThank you for being patient with me. I truly appreciate it, and I hope we can move past this together.\n\nWith heartfelt apologies,  \n[Your Name]",
