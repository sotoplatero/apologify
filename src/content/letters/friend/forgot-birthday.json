    "I hope this message finds you well. I’ve been reflecting on my actions lately, and I feel compelled to reach out and sincerely apologize for forgetting your birthday. I can’t express how regretful I am for missing such an important day in your life.\n\nYou mean a great deal to me, and it hurts to think that I didn’t show you the love and appreciation you deserve on your special day. I can only imagine how disappointing it must have been, and I deeply regret that I wasn’t there to celebrate with you. Please know that it wasn't my intention to overlook you, and I genuinely feel terrible about it.\n\nI value our friendship immensely, and I want to make it right. If you’re open to it, I would love to take you out for coffee or dinner soon—my treat. It would mean a lot to me to catch up, celebrate you properly, and show you how much you truly mean to me.\n\nThank you for your understanding and for being such a wonderful friend. I hope to hear from you soon.\n\nWith heartfelt apologies,  \n[Your Name]"
