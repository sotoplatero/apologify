    "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI’ve been reflecting on a recent conversation, and I want to take a moment to express my deepest regrets. I’m truly sorry for not standing up for you when others spoke poorly about you. In that moment, I should have defended you and made my feelings clear instead of remaining silent.\n\nYou deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it pains me to think that my inaction might have caused you additional hurt. I value our friendship deeply, and the last thing I want is for you to feel unsupported by me.\n\nPlease know that I recognize my mistake, and I am committed to doing better in the future. I hope we can talk about it when you feel ready. Your friendship means a lot to me, and I want to rebuild that trust.\n\nAgain, I’m truly sorry for letting you down.\n\nWith all my heart,  \n[Your Name]"
