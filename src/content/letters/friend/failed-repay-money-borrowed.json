    "Hey [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope you’re doing well! I wanted to take a moment to reach out and apologize for not paying you back yet. I genuinely feel bad for putting you in that situation, and I totally understand if you're feeling frustrated.\n\nLife got a bit hectic on my end, and I appreciate your patience more than I can say. I know it’s important to honor these things, and I promise I'm working on getting it sorted out as soon as possible. \n\nThanks for being such a great friend, and I really appreciate your understanding. Let’s catch up soon—I owe you one!\n\nTake care,\n[Your Name]"
