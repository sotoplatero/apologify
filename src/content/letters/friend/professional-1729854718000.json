In hindsight, I realize that my words could have been hurtful, and I deeply regret any discomfort I may have caused you.\n\nOur friendship means a great deal to me, and I understand that jokes can sometimes cross a line, especially when they touch on sensitive topics. I respect you and value the trust we share, and I am truly sorry for not being more mindful of your feelings in that moment.\n\nPlease know that it was never my intention to upset you. I will be more conscious of my words in the future, and I appreciate your understanding as I work to improve myself.\n\nThank you for your patience and for being such a wonderful friend. I hope we can move past this and continue to share positive moments together.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
