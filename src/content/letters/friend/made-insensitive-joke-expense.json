    "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I’ve been reflecting on our recent conversation, and I can’t shake the feeling of regret for the insensitive joke I made. It was thoughtless and hurtful, and I want you to know how truly sorry I am.\n\nI value our friendship deeply, and it pains me to think that I may have caused you discomfort or hurt you in any way. My intention was never to make light of something important to you, and I realize how my words fell short. I understand that what I said was not just a joke; it undermined the significance of your feelings and experiences.\n\nPlease know that I am committed to being a better friend. I appreciate your kindness, patience, and the trust we’ve built over the years. I promise to be more mindful of my words and their impact in the future.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love the chance to talk more about this or anything else that’s on your mind. Thank you for considering my apology, and I hope we can move past this together.\n\nTake care,\n\n[Your Name]",
