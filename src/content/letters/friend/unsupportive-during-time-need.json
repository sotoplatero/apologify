    "I hope this message finds you well. I've been reflecting on our recent conversations, and I want to take a moment to apologize sincerely for my lack of support during your time of need. \n\nI realize that I wasn’t there for you when you really needed a friend, and I deeply regret that my actions—or lack thereof—didn’t convey how much I care about you. You deserved someone to lean on, and I failed to be that person. \n\nI want you to know that I am truly sorry for not being more attentive and present. Your feelings and experiences matter to me, and it pains me to think that I may have added to your burden instead of helping to lighten it. \n\nPlease know that I am here for you now. I value our friendship deeply, and I hope to earn back your trust. I am committed to being a better friend moving forward, and I am ready to listen and support you in any way you need.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and I hope we can talk soon. \n\nWith all my heartfelt apologies,  \n[Your Name]"
