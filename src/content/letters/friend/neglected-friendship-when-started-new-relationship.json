    "Hey [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope you’re doing well. I’ve been meaning to reach out and talk about something that’s been on my mind lately. I want to sincerely apologize for kind of dropping the ball on our friendship when I got wrapped up in my new relationship. \n\nI know I haven’t been as present, and it’s not fair to you. You’ve always been an important part of my life, and I realize now that I let myself get a little carried away with the newness of things. I should have made more of an effort to stay connected, and I’m really sorry for not doing that.\n\nI value our friendship so much, and I don’t want you to feel like you were pushed aside. Let’s catch up soon—I’d love to hear what you’ve been up to and make sure we’re back on track. Plus, I could really use some friend time!\n\nThanks for understanding, and I hope you can forgive my oversight. \n\nTalk soon!\n\n[Your Name]"
