    "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for sharing the secret you confided in me. It was both unthoughtful and a breach of the trust that you placed in me, and I deeply regret my actions.\n\nI value our friendship immensely, and I understand that this may have caused you hurt or disappointment. You deserved to have your privacy respected, and I failed to uphold that. Please know that it was never my intention to betray your trust or make you feel uncomfortable in any way.\n\nI am committed to learning from this experience and ensuring that it does not happen again. Your friendship is important to me, and I hope to regain your trust in time. If youâ€™re open to it, I would appreciate the chance to discuss this further and hear how you feel.\n\nThank you for considering my apology. I genuinely hope we can move past this.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]"
