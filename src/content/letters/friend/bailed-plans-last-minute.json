    "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to sincerely apologize for bailing on our plans at the last minute. I realize that my sudden change of plans likely caused you disappointment, and for that, I am truly sorry.\n\nIt was not my intention to let you down or disrupt the time we had set aside to enjoy together. Unfortunately, unforeseen circumstances arose that I couldn't control, and it ultimately forced me to make a difficult decision. I understand how important it is to honor commitments, and I regret not communicating with you sooner.\n\nI value our friendship and the time we spend together, and I would love the opportunity to reschedule our plans when it is convenient for you. Please let me know if you'd be open to that, as I genuinely enjoy our time together and would hate for this situation to affect our relationship.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and once again, I apologize for any upset I caused. I appreciate your patience and hope to hear from you soon.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]"
