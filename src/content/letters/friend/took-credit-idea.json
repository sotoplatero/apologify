    "Dear [Friend's Name],\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I’ve been reflecting on our recent conversation, and I feel compelled to reach out and express my sincerest apologies. \n\nI am truly sorry for taking credit for your idea. It was a moment of weakness on my part, and I regret not giving you the recognition you deserve. Your creativity and hard work are the foundation of that idea, and I understand how unfair it was for me to overshadow your contribution.\n\nPlease know that it was never my intention to diminish your efforts or hurt our friendship. I value you not only as a talented friend but also as someone I respect deeply. I’ve learned a significant lesson from this experience, and I promise to be more mindful in the future.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love the opportunity to discuss this further and find a way to make it right. You deserve to be acknowledged for your brilliance, and I want to ensure that you receive the recognition that’s rightfully yours.\n\nThank you for your understanding and for being such a remarkable friend. I hope we can move forward from this and continue to support each other in our endeavors.\n\nWith heartfelt apologies,  \n[Your Name]"
