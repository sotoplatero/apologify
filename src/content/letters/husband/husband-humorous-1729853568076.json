  "letter": "My Dearest Partner in Crime,\n\nI hope this letter finds you well, perhaps enjoying a quiet moment while I’ve been off in my own little universe, lost in the black hole that is work and hobbies—aka the realms of “I swear this is really important!\" \n\nI feel like I might have taken “working hard” to a whole new level, like an Olympic sport where I’ve been competing solo. While I was busy climbing my mountain of work (or was it a pile of laundry?), I completely overlooked the most critical event in my life: you and me, competing for the title of Best Couples’ Bond Ever. Spoiler alert: you were winning!\n\nI want to sincerely apologize for neglecting my most important project—us. I wouldn’t blame you if you were halfway out the door, suitcase packed with a side of popcorn for the show I’ve unintentionally produced called \"Workaholic's Journey.\" But before you go broadcasting my documentary on social media, let’s reset this episode together.\n\nI promise to bring my A-game back to our relationship, and I’ll even let you choose the next hobby or project—though I can’t promise I won’t negotiate hard for a Netflix marathon as the next adventure. After all, my greatest collaboration has always been with you.\n\nSo what do you say? Let’s dust off our favorite board games, grab some takeout, and let the world know that the dynamic duo is back in business! \n\nWith all my love and a sprinkle of extra humor,\nYour decidedly negligent but now reformed partner",
