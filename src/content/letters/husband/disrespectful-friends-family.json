    "My Dearest [Husband's Name],\n\nI hope you can take a moment to read this, as it comes straight from my heart. I want to sincerely apologize for my behavior the other day regarding your friends and family. I realize now that my words and actions were disrespectful, and I am deeply sorry for any hurt I caused you and those you care about.\n\nYou have always shown kindness and warmth to my loved ones, and I should have extended that same respect to yours. It pains me to think that my thoughtlessness may have put a strain on your relationships, as they mean so much to you. I can only imagine how uncomfortable it must have made you feel, and for that, I am truly sorry.\n\nI value our relationship more than anything, and I want to be a partner you can be proud of. Please know that I am reflecting on my behavior and committed to doing better. I want to foster bonds with your loved ones that are as strong and loving as the ones we cherish together.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I love you deeply and hope we can move forward and heal from this. You mean everything to me, and I promise to be more mindful and respectful in the future.\n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]"
