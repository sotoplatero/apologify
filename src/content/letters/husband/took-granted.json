    "My Dearest [Husband's Name],\n\nI want to take a moment to express my deepest apologies for the way I’ve been treating you lately. I’ve come to realize that I have been taking you for granted, and it pains me to acknowledge that. You are such an incredible partner, always supportive and loving, and I haven’t shown you the appreciation you truly deserve.\n\nIn the hustle of everyday life, I became so wrapped up in my own world that I overlooked the little things you do for us – the small gestures, the big sacrifices, and the love you pour into our relationship. I regret not expressing my gratitude and letting you know how much you mean to me. It was never my intention to make you feel undervalued or unappreciated.\n\nPlease know that I am committed to making a change. I want to be the partner you deserve, someone who recognizes the beautiful life we’re building together and cherishes you fully. I hope that we can work through this, and I promise to be more mindful and attentive moving forward.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding as I find my way back to recognizing the incredible man you are. I love you more than words can express, and I am truly sorry for my previous actions.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
