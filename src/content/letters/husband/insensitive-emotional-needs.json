    "Dear [Husband's Name],\n\nI want to take a moment to express how truly sorry I am for my recent insensitivity to your emotional needs. Looking back, I realize that I wasn't attentive to what you were going through, and I deeply regret not being the partner you needed during that time.\n\nYou deserve someone who listens and supports you wholeheartedly, and I'm sorry for any hurt my actions may have caused. It was never my intention to make you feel unheard or undervalued. I now see how my words and actions fell short, and I wish I had been more mindful of your feelings.\n\nYour emotions are important to me, and I want to be the kind of partner who nurtures and uplifts you. I promise to do better, to be more aware of your needs, and to create a safe space where you feel comfortable sharing what’s on your mind or in your heart.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I’m committed to working on this, and I hope we can move forward together, stronger than before.\n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]"
