    "My Dearest [Husband's Name],\n\nI hope you can find it in your heart to read this note without any walls up, as I want to express how truly sorry I am for my recent insensitivity toward your emotional needs. I’ve been reflecting on our interactions, and I realize that I haven’t been as attentive as you deserve.\n\nYou are always so open and honest with me about what you’re feeling, and I see now that my responses and actions did not show the understanding and compassion that you needed. It pains me to know that I let you down when you were seeking support. You mean the world to me, and the last thing I ever wanted was to make you feel unheard or undervalued.\n\nI regret not taking the time to really listen and engage with you in the way that you needed.

I want you to know how much I care, and how dedicated I am to improving our communication.\n\nPlease forgive me for my insensitivity.

    "My Dearest,\n\nI hope you can find a moment to hear my words and the feelings behind them. I want to start by saying how truly sorry I am for the way I have been insensitive to your emotional needs. I’ve taken your feelings for granted, and that realization breaks my heart.\n\nI know that I haven’t always been there for you when you needed me, and instead, I let my own thoughts and worries overshadow what was truly important—your feelings. I failed to recognize the signs that you were struggling, and for that, I deeply regret my lack of understanding.\n\nPlease know that my intentions were never to hurt you. I value you, our relationship, and the beautiful bond we share so much. The last thing I would ever want is to make you feel unsupported or alone. I want to learn from this experience so that I can be the partner you deserve, one who listens and is attuned to your needs.\n\nI promise to do better. I want to communicate more openly and ensure that you feel safe sharing your emotions with me. Your feelings matter to me, and I want to help you feel visible and valued, just as you deserve.\n\nThank you for your patience with me, even in my shortcomings. I love you deeply and cherish our journey together. \n\nWith all my heart,  \n[Your Name]"
