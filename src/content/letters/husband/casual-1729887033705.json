You do so much for us, and it’s easy to get caught up in the routine and forget to appreciate all the little things you do.\n\nI truly value all the love and support you give me, and it’s time I start showing that more. I promise to be more mindful and recognize just how lucky I am to have you by my side.\n\nThanks for being so patient with me. You really mean the world to me, and I want to make sure you feel that every day.\n\nLove you lots,\n\n[Your Name]",
