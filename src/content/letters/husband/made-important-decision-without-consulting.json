    "Dear [Husband's Name],\n\nI hope you can take a moment to read this letter. I want to sincerely apologize for making an important decision without consulting you first. I realize that this may have caused you to feel excluded and undervalued, and that was never my intention.\n\nI should have considered your thoughts and feelings before moving forward. Our partnership means the world to me, and I deeply regret not incorporating your perspective into this decision. I understand that communication is essential, and I promise to do better in the future.\n\nYour support and input matter so much to me, and I want us to face these choices together. Please know that I am committed to being more open and collaborative going forward. \n\nThank you for your understanding and patience. I love you, and I hope we can talk about this when youâ€™re ready.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
