    "My Dearest [Husband's Name],\n\nI hope you can take a moment to read what I’m about to say, as it comes straight from my heart. I want to sincerely apologize for how I’ve been lately. It’s become painfully clear to me that I’ve been neglecting you and our relationship in favor of my work and hobbies, and I am truly sorry.\n\nI realize now how my focus on other things has left you feeling unappreciated and alone, and that is the last thing I ever wanted. You deserve my time, my attention, and my love, and I can see that I haven’t been giving you that lately. I’ve allowed my passions to take precedence over the most important part of my life—you.\n\nPlease know that I deeply value what we have together. I cherish our moments, our laughter, and even our quiet times. You mean everything to me, and I regret allowing anything else to overshadow that. I’m committed to making a change. I want to prioritize us and nurture our relationship just as much as I have my work or my hobbies.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I am truly sorry for the hurt my actions may have caused you. You are my partner, my best friend, and I want to be better for you.\n\nI love you more than I can express, and I promise to show you just how much you mean to me.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]",
    "Hey Love,\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to say I'm really sorry. Lately, I’ve been so wrapped up in work and my hobbies that I’ve completely neglected the most important part of my life—us. I realize now how much I've taken your love and support for granted, and that’s not fair to you.\n\nYou mean the world to me, and it hurts to think that my actions may have made you feel unappreciated or overlooked. I’m committed to making a change because our relationship deserves my full attention and energy. \n\nLet’s carve out some time to reconnect, just the two of us. I miss our late-night talks and spontaneous adventures together. Thank you for being patient with me—I promise to do better. \n\nLove you lots,\n\n[Your Name]"
