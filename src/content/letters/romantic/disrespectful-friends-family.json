    "I want to take a moment to express how truly sorry I am for my behavior the other day. I know that I was disrespectful to your friends and family, and it pains me to think that I caused you discomfort or embarrassment.\n\nYou deserve to be surrounded by people who lift you up, and by acting the way I did, I let both you and your loved ones down. I realize how important those relationships are to you, and I regret not showing the respect they deserve. I take full responsibility for my words and actions in that moment, and I can only imagine how you felt watching it all unfold.\n\nPlease know that this was never my intention. You mean the world to me, and I care deeply about the people who matter to you. I have reflected a lot since then, and I am committed to being more mindful of how I express myself, especially in social settings. I want to learn from this and grow, not just for myself, but for us.\n\nI hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I value our relationship immensely, and I’m willing to put in the effort to rebuild any trust that may have been shaken. If you're open to it, I’d love a chance to make it up to you and to your friends and family.\n\nThank you for your understanding and patience. I love you, and I promise to do better moving forward.",

I understand how important your friends and family are to you, and my behavior did not reflect the respect that I have for them or for you. I recognize that my conduct may have caused you distress, and I deeply regret any embarrassment or hurt I may have caused.\n\nPlease know that I am committed to making amends and ensuring that this does not happen again. I greatly value our relationship and the bonds you share with those close to you. Moving forward, I will strive to be more considerate and mindful of my words and actions.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding.
