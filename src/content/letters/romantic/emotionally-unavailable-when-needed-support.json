    "I’ve been reflecting on the past few weeks, and I need to express how truly sorry I am for not being there for you when you needed me. I recognize that I was emotionally unavailable, and I can only imagine how isolating and frustrating that must have felt for you.\n\nYou deserved my full attention, love, and support, especially during such a challenging time. Instead, I turned inward when I should have been reaching out to you. I regret missing those moments when you relied on me, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid. You are incredibly important to me, and I hate that I didn't show you the support you needed.\n\nI’m committed to understanding what kept me from being present, and I want to work on being more open and available for you in the future. You deserve a partner who stands by you wholeheartedly, and I am determined to be that person for you.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d really like to talk about how we can move forward together. Thank you for your patience and for loving me, even when I faltered. I care about you deeply, and I hope we can find a way to heal together. \n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]",
    "I hope this message finds you well. I want to take a moment to express my sincerest apologies for not being there for you in the way that you needed during a challenging time. \n\nI have come to realize that my emotional unavailability may have caused you pain or frustration when you were seeking my support. Please know that it was never my intention to let you down or make you feel neglected. I recognize that being a partner means being present and available, and I regret falling short of that expectation.\n\nYour feelings are important to me, and I understand that my actions (or lack thereof) may have made you feel unsupported or isolated. I am committed to reflecting on this experience and making the necessary changes to ensure that I am more attuned to your needs in the future.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding during this time. I value our relationship deeply and hope to rebuild the trust that may have been shaken. Please know that I am here for you now, ready to listen and support you in any way you need.\n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]"
