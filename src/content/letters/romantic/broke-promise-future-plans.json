You deserve so much better, and I understand how my actions may have shaken your trust in me.\n\nPlease know that I am desperately trying to learn from this experience. I want to be the partner who always stands by you, who lifts you up and shares in our vision for the future. I recognize now how important it is to communicate openly and to remain accountable, and I am committed to doing better. \n\nYour feelings matter to me more than anything, and I want to hear everything you have to say. I’m ready to listen, and I hope we can talk about this when you feel ready.
