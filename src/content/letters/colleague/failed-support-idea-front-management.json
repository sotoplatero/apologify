    "Dear [Colleague's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for not supporting your idea in front of management during our recent meeting. I realize that my lack of endorsement may have undermined the value of your proposal, and for that, I am truly sorry.\n\nYour idea was thoughtful and had the potential to make a significant impact on our project. I regret that I didn't communicate my appreciation for it more effectively and stand by you as the champion of your vision. It was never my intention to make you feel unsupported or overlooked.\n\nMoving forward, I want to make sure I am more actively engaged in supporting our team’s initiatives. I believe in the importance of collaboration, and I want you to know that I value your contributions immensely. If you’re open to it, I’d love the chance to discuss your ideas further and find ways to advocate for them in the future.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and I hope we can move past this together. Your work is important to me, and I want to do better by you and our team.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]"
