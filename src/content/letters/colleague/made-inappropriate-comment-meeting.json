I recognize that every voice matters, including yours, and I am dedicated to ensuring that our discussions remain inclusive and supportive.\n\nPlease know that I have taken this situation to heart. I am committed to learning from this experience and making sure that it does not happen again. Thank you for your understanding and for your continued professionalism.
