    "Hey [Colleague's Name],\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to sincerely apologize for my comment during the meeting the other day. Looking back, I realize it was out of line and not appropriate for the conversation. I definitely didn’t mean to make anyone uncomfortable or to undermine the important work we’re doing as a team.\n\nI value our collaboration and the positive environment we’ve built, and I appreciate your understanding. I’ll be more mindful in the future to ensure that doesn’t happen again.\n\nThanks for being such a great colleague, and I hope we can move past this.\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]"
