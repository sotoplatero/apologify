  "letter": "Dear [Colleague's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for my thoughtless comments about you to our coworkers. Reflecting on the situation, I realize how damaging my words can be, not just to your reputation, but also to the sense of trust and respect that we should uphold within our team.\n\nI am truly sorry for any hurt or discomfort I may have caused you. It was wrong of me to speak negatively and I regret not taking the opportunity to address any issues directly with you instead. I value the contributions you make to our work environment, and I realize now that my actions undermined that.\n\nPlease know that I am committed to making amends and demonstrating through my actions that I respect and support you. I hope to rebuild the trust that I have damaged, and I'm here to listen if you would like to discuss this further.\n\nThank you for your understanding. I genuinely appreciate your patience and hope we can move forward positively.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
