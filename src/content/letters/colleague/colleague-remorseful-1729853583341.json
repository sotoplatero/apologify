  "letter": "Dear [Colleague's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to sincerely apologize for my repeated tardiness to our meetings. I realize that my lack of punctuality has not only been disruptive but has also shown a lack of respect for your time and our collaborative efforts.\n\nI understand how important it is for us to work together efficiently, and I regret any frustration my lateness may have caused you. It was never my intention to undermine our teamwork or the valuable contributions you bring to our projects.\n\nMoving forward, I am committed to improving my time management and ensuring that I arrive promptly for our meetings. I truly value our working relationship and the progress we make together, and I appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.\n\nThank you for your continued collaboration, and I hope we can put this behind us and move forward positively.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
