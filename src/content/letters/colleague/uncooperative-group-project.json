    "I hope this message finds you well. \n\nI want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for my lack of cooperation during our recent group project. I realize that my actions may have disrupted our collaboration and affected the team's dynamics. I understand how important effective teamwork is, and I regret not meeting that expectation.\n\nLooking back, I recognize the importance of everyone’s contributions, including yours, and how my uncooperative attitude might have added unnecessary stress to the project. I never intended to undermine the collective effort, and I'm truly sorry for not being a better team player.\n\nI value our working relationship and would like to ensure that we can move forward positively. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to make amends or if you’d like to discuss this further. \n\nThank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your hard work on the project.\n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]  "
