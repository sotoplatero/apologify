    "Hey [Colleague's Name],\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to reach out and apologize for my recent comments about you. Honestly, I didn’t mean to speak negatively, and I completely regret it. It was thoughtless of me, and I can only imagine how it made you feel.\n\nI really value our working relationship, and I appreciate everything you bring to the team. I promise to be more mindful of my words in the future. If you’re open to it, I’d love to chat and clear the air.\n\nThanks for understanding, and again, I’m really sorry.\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]"
