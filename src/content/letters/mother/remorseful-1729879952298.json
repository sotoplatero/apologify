  "letter": "Dear Mom,\n\nI hope you can take a moment to read this note, as I feel it’s important to express just how sorry I am for breaking my promise to spend time together. I know how much our time means to you, and I genuinely regret letting you down.\n\nI allowed myself to get caught up in other commitments and distractions, which I know is not an excuse. You have always prioritized our time together, and it was wrong of me to take it for granted. I can only imagine how hurtful my actions were, and I deeply regret not being there for you as promised.\n\nPlease know that you are incredibly important to me, and I value every moment we share. I am committed to making this right and ensuring that I show you the love and attention you deserve. If you’re willing, I would love to reschedule our time together so we can bond the way we should have.\n\nThank you for your understanding and for being such a wonderful mother. I hope you can forgive me.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]",
