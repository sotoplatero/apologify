    "Dear Mom,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to sincerely apologize for my words during our recent argument. I know I said something that hurt you, and I deeply regret allowing my emotions to take control in that moment.\n\nIt was never my intention to cause you pain, and I can't express enough how sorry I am for the thoughtlessness of my remarks. Our relationship means the world to me, and I recognize that my actions may have jeopardized that trust and closeness.\n\nIâ€™ve taken some time to reflect on the situation, and I realize how important it is for me to communicate with you more thoughtfully. I value our conversations and the love we share, which is why it pains me to think I could have damaged that with my words.\n\nPlease know that I am committed to learning from this experience and striving to be more respectful and understanding in our discussions. I appreciate your patience with me and hope we can find a way to move forward together.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I love you and look forward to making things right.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
