    "Dear Mom,\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I’ve been thinking about our plans, and I can’t express how truly sorry I am for breaking my promise to spend time together. I know how much our time means to you, and it breaks my heart that I let you down.\n\nI want you to know that it was never my intention to hurt you. Life got in the way, and I lost sight of what truly matters—the moments we share together. You deserve my time and attention, and I regret not prioritizing those precious moments with you.\n\nPlease forgive me for my thoughtlessness. It’s important to me that you know how much I value our relationship and the time we have as mother and child. I’m committed to making it up to you and ensuring this doesn’t happen again.\n\nI would love to reschedule our time together soon, whenever it works for you. Let’s create some new memories that we can cherish.\n\nThank you for your understanding and patience. I love you more than words can express.\n\nWith all my love,  \n[Your Name]"
