  "letter": "Dear Mom,\n\nI hope you're sitting down because I’m about to dive into an apology so heartfelt it might just need its own Hallmark card. \n\nFirst off, let’s get one thing straight: I appreciate you more than chocolate chip cookies on a rainy day (and that’s saying a lot). But somewhere between midterms and binge-watching questionable reality TV, I might have drifted into the “oblivious teenager” zone. I completely failed to recognize the Herculean efforts you've made—like a superhero in sweatpants—keeping my life running smoothly while ensuring I didn’t starve or end up wearing two different shoes to school.\n\nI’m sorry for not highlighting the sheer magnificence of your sacrifices, like the countless hours you’ve spent defending my honor during parent-teacher conferences and the extensive research you did on the perfect bedtime. Who knew bedtime stories could require so much background checking? If anyone should be profiting off my bedtimes, it should definitely be you!\n\nIn your tireless quest for my happiness, you’ve shown me that love sometimes means giving up your long-deserved “me time” for my many questionable pursuits. Here’s my solemn vow: from now on, I’ll make it my mission to shower you with the appreciation you deserve—beginning right after I finish this letter. (Spoiler alert: I plan to bake cookies, but don’t hold your breath. I might just burn them to a crisp.)\n\nSo thank you for being my ultimate life coach, drama queen, and pizza delivery extraordinaire. I promise to be a more appreciative child moving forward, complete with high-fives and frequent praise—just in case you ever doubt your amazingness again (which, by the way, is impossible).\n\nLove you more than my Wi-Fi connection!\n\nYour somewhat clueless (but now enlightened) child,  \n[Your Name]",
