    "Hey Mom,\n\nI just wanted to take a minute to say I’m really sorry for not listening to your advice. I thought I had things figured out, but it turns out I was totally wrong. You always know what’s best, and I should have trusted your judgment.\n\nIt’s embarrassing to admit, but I made a mistake and now I see how your guidance could have helped me avoid it. I appreciate you always being there for me and offering your wisdom, even when I don’t take it. \n\nI promise to do better next time and really listen to what you have to say. Thanks for being patient with me. Love you lots!\n\nTalk soon,  \n[Your Name]"
