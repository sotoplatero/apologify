    "Dear Mom,\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to sincerely apologize for missing our weekly family dinner. I know how much these gatherings mean to all of us, and I’m truly sorry for not being there with you and the family.\n\nLife has been hectic lately, and I allowed myself to get caught up in things that shouldn’t have taken priority over our time together. I regret not being present and the disappointment I may have caused you. It’s important to me to honor our family traditions, and I feel terrible for letting you down.\n\nI miss our conversations and the warmth of being surrounded by family. Please know that I value these moments deeply, and I promise to make a greater effort to prioritize our time together moving forward. \n\nThank you for your understanding and for always being such a loving and supportive mom. I love you and can’t wait to catch up soon.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
