    "Dear Mom,\n\nI hope this note finds you well, though I know I haven’t been the best son/daughter lately. I want to sincerely apologize for neglecting my responsibilities around the house and not helping with the chores as I should have.\n\nI realize that my actions have not only added to your workload but also shown a lack of consideration for all the effort you put into keeping our home running smoothly. You do so much for our family, and I’m truly sorry for not stepping up to share the burden. \n\nI understand how frustrating it must be to feel like you’re shouldering everything alone, and I want you to know that it wasn’t my intention to make you feel that way. I’ve reflected on my behavior, and I’m committed to doing better. I want to be someone you can rely on at home, just as you’ve always relied on me to be a responsible member of our family.\n\nThank you for your patience and for all the love you consistently give. I promise to make it up to you by helping out more actively with chores from now on.\n\nWith all my love and remorse,\n\n[Your Name]"
