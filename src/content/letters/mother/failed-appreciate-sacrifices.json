    "Dear Mom,\n\nI hope this note finds you well. I’ve been reflecting on my actions and the words I’ve spoken lately, and I feel compelled to reach out and express my sincerest apologies.\n\nI realize that I have failed to fully appreciate the countless sacrifices you have made for me over the years. Your unwavering support and selflessness have shaped my life in ways I often take for granted. I understand now that these sacrifices came from a place of love, and I am truly sorry for not acknowledging them as I should have.\n\nI regret any hurt my lack of appreciation may have caused you. You have always put my needs before your own, and I didn’t recognize the depth of your commitment until now. Thank you for being my greatest advocate and for the countless ways you’ve nurtured and guided me. I want you to know that I am listening and learning, and I promise to be more aware of the love and effort you pour into our family.\n\nPlease forgive me for my insensitivity. I am deeply grateful to have you as my mother, and I hope to show you that gratitude more consistently moving forward. \n\nWith all my love,\n\n[Your Name]"
