<p>A cordial apology letter may seem like a simple gesture, but its impact can be profound. When reaching out to a classmate, expressing genuine remorse, taking responsibility, and demonstrating a commitment to change can mend relationships that might otherwise fester.</p>
<p>Think back to the last time someone hurt your feelings.
